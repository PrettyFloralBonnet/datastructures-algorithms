# Searching / Traversal
## Linear Search
Linear search is a method of finding a target value within a list by sequentially checking each element for it. In a worst case scenario, linear search has an O(n), because we need to traverse the entire list.
## Binary Search
Binary search starts from an element in the middle of the list and checks if its value is higher or lower than the value of the target element (this assumes the list is sorted). Based on that comparison, it discards half of the list at once (either to the left or to the right), and repeats this until the target value is found.
