# Sorting
The three most commonly used sorting algorithms are:
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort

Then there are two more advanced ones, which usually outperform the previous three:
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

## Bubble Sort
Takes pairs of elements in the unsorted collection and compares them, pair by pair, switching the two elements in each pair around until all are sorted. Easy on memory use, but not very efficient.
