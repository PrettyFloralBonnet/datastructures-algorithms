# Graphs
A **graph** is a set of interrelated items which are paired with one another. In a graph, each item is called a **node** or a **vertex**, and a connection between nodes/vertices is referred to as an **edge**. Graphs are typically used to model real world relationships.  

Graphs are a superset of trees (which themselves are a superset of linked lists).

## Types of graphs
Graphs can be **directed** or **undirected** (which describes the directional relationship between vertices), **weighted** or **unweighted** (whether or not the edges carry information in addition to vertices) and **cyclic** or **acyclic** (if vertices are connected in a circular fashion, it's called a cycle).
