## Hash Tables

**Hash tables** are basically **key-value pairs**. The values are stored in memory based on the result of **hash functions** applied to the keys.  
  
A **hash function** is a function that generates **a value of fixed length** for every input that it gets. If the input does not change, neither will the output (a shorthand for this property is to say that a hash function is **idempotent**)
