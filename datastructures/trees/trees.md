# Trees
**Trees** have a hierarchical structure. They usually start with a **root** (parent) node, which every child in the tree descends from. Parent-child relationship goes one way. A series of nodes within a tree may be referred to as **subtree**. The nodes on the same level are referred to as **siblings**. The nodes at the end of a tree data structure are referred to as **leaf nodes**.  
  
An example of a tree data structure is the **DOM**. Also, a **linked list** is technically a type of tree, with a single path, but a node in a tree can only point to the child (nodes don't have to reference the parent).
