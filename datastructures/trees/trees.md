# Trees
**Trees** have a hierarchical structure. They usually start with a **root** (parent) node, which every child in the tree descends from. Parent-child relationship goes one way. A series of nodes within a tree may be referred to as **subtree**. The nodes on the same level are referred to as **siblings**. The nodes at the end of a tree data structure are referred to as **leaf nodes**.  
  
An example of a tree data structure is the **DOM**. Also, a **linked list** is technically a type of tree, with a single path, but a node in a tree can only point to the child (nodes don't have to reference the parent).

## Binary Tree
Each node can have either 0, 1 or 2 children. Each child can only have one parent. A **full binary tree** is a binary tree that has no gaps - all the leaf nodes are full. There is no node that only has 1 child - all nodes have either 0 children, or 2 children. A **perfect binary tree** is a full binary tree that has its bottom layer completely filled. With perfect binary trees, the number of nodes doubles each time we go down a level, and the sum of nodes the last level is equal to the sum of nodes on all other levels, plus one. This kind of binary tree has an O(log n).
