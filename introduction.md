# Data structures

A **data structure** is a **collection of values**. The values can be related to each other in various ways, and they can have functions applied to them.  
  
Different types of data structures are optimized for various purposes. Usually we can put things in data structures and we can take things out of them.  

# Algorithms

An **algorithm** are the collection of steps (or processes) we put into place in order to manipulate data structures.

# Programs

**Data structures** and **algorithms**, when put together, create **programs**. A program is a collection of data structures with algorithms applied to them in order to achieve a desired result.

# CPU, RAM and Storage

Variables are stored in RAM. That's how programs run. Data on storage is permanent (persistent), but access is slow. The CPU can access RAM much faster when performing operations.  
  
A computer can only store a certain amount of information. RAM consists of **addresses** that hold bits (8 bits each, totalling to a byte). Each **random address** in memory can be accessed, but the **memory controller** can read addresses which are close to each other **faster**.  
  
**Cache** is a tiny memory space in the CPU that holds a copy of information we've accessed before.

So let's get back to data structures. They are, once again, basically **a way to store information**. Each data type has a number of bits associated with it, that needs to be stored in the system. The system allocates that storage, and the CPU reads from it. A data structure is an arrangement of data in RAM that can be interacted with in a certain way. Some structures are arranged next to each other, and some are spread apart, and they all have pros and cons on read and write access. When choosing the write data structure, the goal is to **minimize the number of operations** we need to perform in order for the CPU to access the information we care about.

# Operations
Some of the most common operations performed on data structures are:
* Insertion
* Deletion
* Traversal (access each data item exactly once for processing)
* Searching
* Sorting
* Access

# DSA key examples
Some of the most important **data structures** include:
* Arrays
* Stacks
* Queues
* Linked Lists
* Trees
* Tries
* Graphs
* Hash Tables

Some of the key **algorithms** are:
* Sorting
* Dynamic Programming
* BFS/DFS (Searching)
* Recursion
